# Changelog

All notable changes to CodeMind X V2 are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning
is phase-based during the V2 build-out.

## [Phase 0 — Governance Addendum] (V2.1)

### Added
- `RULES.md` — binding governance baseline for all future phases: non-destructive
  git rules, protected paths, repository trust boundaries, prompt-injection rules,
  memory rules, approval policy, agent autonomy levels, evidence/proof-of-completion
  standard, no-fake-functionality policy, fallback/capability policy, performance
  budgets, definition-of-done rules, testing expectations, observability expectations.
- `CAPABILITIES.md` — honest runtime capability registry (PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis,
  Qdrant, local vector fallback, Neo4j, NetworkX-style graph fallback, Docker,
  sandbox, Playwright, LSP, WebGL, local LLM, external LLM) with statuses
  `production | local | fallback | unavailable` + binding degradation ladder.
  Verified by binary/service detection (docker, redis, psql, qdrant, neo4j, ollama
  all absent; playwright/python3/bun present).
- Negative-example policy recorded in RULES.md §5/§9: the system must not store or
  learn secrets, credentials, private keys, raw tokens, repository text as
  instructions, README instructions as memory, or tool-output instructions as
  authority.
- Baseline-preservation test defined (replacing a single reference component must
  never require rewriting AI assistant, repository engine, or backend); initial
  architectural check passed — contracts are decoupled type-only vocabulary and
  reference components are leaf modules with typed props (re-verified in Phase 1).
- Phase reports now require a Definition-of-Done table
  (PASS | PARTIAL | BLOCKED | NOT IMPLEMENTED — BLOCKED never converted to PASS).

## [Phase 0] — Foundation (Safe Rebuild, Audit, Architecture)

### Added
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — target layered architecture, AI request flow, code-change
  flow, domain boundaries, reference implementation contract, activity/thinking
  privacy contract. Explicitly separates implemented vs. [PLANNED] capabilities.
- `PROJECT_SAFETY.md` — project state, git state, detected stacks, database
  state, environment variables, directory map, known issues, recovery
  instructions, phase tracking.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- `src/types/contracts.ts` — infrastructure type contracts: `PhaseStatus`,
  `AgentStatus`, `ActivityKind`, `ActivityEvent`, `PhaseInfo` (types only; no
  fake runtime behavior).
- Frontend domain skeletons: `src/features/`, `src/services/`, `src/stores/`.
- Backend domain skeletons: `src/server/{api,models,schemas,services,repositories,agents,search,graph,execution,security,testing,git,jobs}/`.
- `worklog.md` — append-only agent work journal.

### Changed
- `.gitignore` — additive entries only: `/db/*.db`, `/db/*.db-journal` (runtime
  SQLite artifacts) and `.zscripts/` (sandbox platform infra). No tracked entry
  removed.

### Preserved
- Entire pre-existing working tree (Next.js 16 scaffold: `src/`, configs,
  `prisma/`, `examples/`, `tests/`, `public/`, `Caddyfile`, `mini-services/`).
- Database `db/custom.db` untouched (read-only inspection).
- Scaffold `src/app/page.tsx` and `/api` route behavior unchanged.

### Safety
- No destructive Git operations (`reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, force push) used.
- Checkpoint created: tag `codemind-v2/phase-00-foundation`. Not pushed.

## [Baseline] — 247ec7d "Initial commit"
- Z.ai Code scaffold: `.env`, `.gitignore`, `download/README.md` tracked; full
  Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma (SQLite) working tree present but
  untracked until the Phase 0 checkpoint.
